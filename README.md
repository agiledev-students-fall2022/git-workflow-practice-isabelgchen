### Why I like it...

I find this specific article very interesting because it discusses the commonplace of using tracking software to monitor employees. The New York Times created an interactive article in which they simulated the feeling of measuring "worker productivity with monitoring software." This was simulated using pop-ups that would appear at certain times while the reader was scrolling through the article. For example, a pop-up saying "We can tell you're idling" comes up when the user hasn't moved their screen in 30 seconds. The user also gets "graded" on how fast and efficiently they read the article. The creators even tried to play around with the feeling of being tracked by using a very visually appealing theme with the pop-ups to hopefully make the user feel better or even good about the tracking. Overall, many people said this experimental article provoked anxiety and possibly even some panis as they scrolled through.

This article makes me think about the feeling on being "tracked" that many young people have noticed recently. Many times, myself included, I have noticed that certain things I say outloud show up as an advertisement on Instagram later. It definitely makes me wonder how much of my personal life I am giving away. Of course, this article also makes me think about popular monitoring software that companies use, such as Microsoft Teams. Teams changes your activity from green to yellow if you haven't been active in a few minutes. I know many people try to hack this by moving their mouse every few minutes, or even tying their mouse to something that moves so they don't have to do it themselves. It makes me wonder if this montitoring software is succeeding at what it intends to.
